<h2>About the Course</h2>
<p>
The online Data Analytics Career Accelerator from The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) aims to equip working professionals and career starters with the knowledge they need to lead critical, data-backed decision making in organisations across industries. 

Over 6 months, I developed fundamental knowledge, skills and applied project experience in data analytics across enterprise databases and tools. I built coding skills in the high-demand data programming languages Python and R, and practiced their application to data projects in authentic business scenarios. I also further developed and strengthened my communication skills including data visualisation, to ensure analysis and insight to support actionable business decisions.

The content of the program includes three courses and an employer project, where I built a portfolio of evidence to showcase newly learned skills and competencies, with a strong focus on becoming a reflective practitioner, and becoming equipped with the mindset and tools to solve problems and effectively acquire new technical, business and human skills.

<h3>Employer Project</h3>

Collaborating with fellow learners on a real-world employer project in a culmination of the skills acquired in the first three courses.
The project is designed by a leading technology company to reflect the practical skills required by industry. 
Requires a synthesis of the methods and techniques developed, and is based on a genuine employer need and interest.
